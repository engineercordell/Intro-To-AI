# Intro-To-AI
A summation of my artificial intelligence class projects from summer 2024 ranging from path-finding algorithms to probabilistic inferencing and finally to supervised machine learning techniques.

### Project 1: Pacman Search to explore path-finding algorithms like DFS, BFS, Dijkstra's, and A* Search.
### Project 2: Reinforcement Learning via Value Iteration, Policies, and Q-Learning
### Project 3: Inferencing and Joint Particle Filtering
### Project 4: Machine Learning and Neural Networks
